  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>This auto loan pre-qualification app is really user friendly, operates smooth and quickly to get a 
  user fast results. It is mobile and desktop responsive and It takes the user through 5 simple steps to determine if they would be eligible for
  an auto loan. If the user has a credit score lower than 600 or the purchase price they enter
   is higher than 1/5th of their income they will disqualify and be routed to a disqualify route that will render a message fetched from a fake rest api that I created. If its detemined that they
   are eligible they will be routed to create an account</p>
  <P>(If user enters an amount higher than $1,000,000 a bad request message coming from the fake
 rest api will be rendered to alert the user)</p>
